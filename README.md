# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Rohan here.

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto, and am currently looking for fresh graduate opportunities in Software Development.

Since I was young, I've had a huge passion for science, both the natural and especially the technological. I hope to apply those passions in a fulfilling way, and hopefully make the world better in some small (or big!) way along the way.

Outside of writing code and building software, I enjoy playing video games, reading (mainly sci-fi), and cooking.
