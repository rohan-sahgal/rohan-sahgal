# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Rohan here.

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto, and am currently looking for opportunities in Software Development.

Since I was young, I've had a huge passion for science, both the natural and especially the technological. I hope to apply those passions in a fulfilling way and do my part in making the world a better place.

Outside of writing code and building software, I enjoy playing rock climbing, photography, biking, and being in nature.
