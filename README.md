Hi, I'm Rohan!

I'm a recent Computer Science grad from the University of Toronto, and am currently looking for fresh graduate opportunities in Software Development.

Since I was young, I've had a huge passion for science, both the natural and the technological. My goal is to apply those passions in a fulfilling way, and hopefully make the world better along the way (however small it may be).
